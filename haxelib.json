  "releasenote": "A tonne of bug fixes.  Moving towards a 1.0 release, even though I think 2.0 is already planned ;)
  Don't fail dtx-show, dtx-hide and other attributes when there is a null expression.  
  Don't DCE variables created when running string interpolation on an element attribute in your template.  
  Better handling of val() on a checkbox: Before it returned 'true' or 'false' as a string.  Now it returns the value of the 'value= attribute if it exists and is checked, the string 'checked' if no 'value=' attribute exists and is checked, or '' (an empty string) if it is not checked.  
  More fixes for partials in JS, where due to browser HTML strictness things a span placeholder would never be placed into a tr container, etc, so when the partial tried to replace the placeholder, the placeholder did not exist, and so the partial is never created. 
  Add support for `dtx-bind-value`, `dtx-bind-(int|float)-value`, `dtx-on-*` and `dtx-content` widget helpers.
  Fix use of member functions on the widget (not a member function of a property of a widget) in interpolation.
  Change Loop.addItem() to return the already existing item if `preventDuplicates` is true and the item already exists.",
